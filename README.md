# Expense-monitoring-System

The Expense Monitoring System is designed as a comprehensive and interactive platform that assists users in monitoring, tracking, categorizing, and analyzing their expenses. It includes a feature for setting monthly budget limits, enabling users to effectively manage their finances. This system is particularly useful for users to study and track their spending patterns, offering insights into their monthly or yearly expenditure.

A key feature of this system is the 'Group Expense Manager', which allows users to create groups for managing shared expenses. This function supports various split methods, facilitating users to add expenses to a group and settle them efficiently. It also provides a payment summary detailing how expenses are divided and settled among group members.

The system's dashboard analytics offer a detailed overview of personal spending, presented through time series and categorized by spending types. This feature is instrumental in helping users develop healthy spending habits, ultimately contributing to their financial security and well-being.
